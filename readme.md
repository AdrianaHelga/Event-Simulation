# Event Simulation Project

This project is the implementation of single queue system. Three points correspond to the most important characteristics of a queuing system. They are explained below:

Arrival Process: The probability density distribution that determines the customer arrivals in the system. In a messaging system, this refers to the message arrival probability distribution.

Service Process: The probability density distribution that determines the customer service times in the system. In a messaging system, this refers to the message transmission time distribution. Since message transmission is directly proportional to the length of the message, this parameter indirectly refers to the message length distribution.

Number of Servers: Number of servers available to service the customers. In a messaging system, this refers to the number of links between the source and destination nodes.
